This CTF challenge is based on the RSA encryption algorithm, a widely-used and highly secure method of public key encryption. However, the integrity of the encryption is only as strong as the key used. In this challenge, you have been given a file called "ciphertext.bin" containing an RSA-encrypted message. Your task is to decrypt the message and uncover the hidden flag within. The private key used for decryption has been provided, but the public key used for encryption remains unknown.

The vulnerability this challenge is based on is the potential use of weak or easily guessable keys in RSA encryption. This vulnerability is well-documented and can result in the encryption being easily decrypted by an attacker. It is crucial to ensure that strong and unique keys are used in order to maintain the security of the encryption. Can you uncover the hidden flag and prove your mastery of RSA encryption?
